A monster simulation & battler inspired by Tamagotchi. I handled the bulk of the programming and the prelimary design/planning, while [Usman Khan](https://usmankhang.github.io/) created all the original pixel art, and a small additional group provided music, testing and insight. This on-and-off development cycle lasted 8 years overall, with the final major updates coming in 2024.

VirtuaCreature was built using Adobe AIR, and utizilized SmartFoxServer 2X to foster an online ecosystem for in-game giveaways, events, and multiplayer matches, at its peak hosting over 10,000 accounts across PC, Android & iOS platforms.
