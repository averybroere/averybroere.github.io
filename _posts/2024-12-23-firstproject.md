> It is almost disorienting to remember how long VirtuaCreature consumed our lives.

A year has passed since I wrote that down, and yet somehow, my first real game is *still* refusing to die.

There are generally two clashing ideals for game devs that are starting out. The first is to waste no time and focus on volume - it's bound to reasonable logic, being that frankly, you probably suck at making things, and it's going to take many attempts before something worth playing emerges from your efforts. The second is, uh:

> It is so sick to me spiritually that the universal indie dev advice is to make as many shit games as you can in a short period instead of working on a grand and beautiful tapestry with the awesome awesome essence over the years...
>
>...This is advice for beginners and aspiring game devs that condemns them to eternal mediocrity. You have to go big or go home because the "competition" that every indie dev refers to is just DETRITUS made by "beginners" that only serves to clog up the internet and make $300

I do vibe with this sentiment a lot, mainly because it's what I chose to do years ago, but at the same time I regret it in a sense, because for most people it simply *does not* work. I've never been someone good at or interested in marketing (being crazy on the internet is still effective marketing in the case of the above dev), and so the scale of effort that went into my crap vs the reward stops making sense the less I reflexively try to justify it as a learning experience.

VirtuaCreature is today much better than it was 6 years ago at launch, of course. Everyone got more meticulous, our skillsets grew, and it became more like a managed cohesive project rather than a disorganized endless march. But I also threw away ideas that were probably better, in insistence that *this* idea was going to work if we just figured it out. I likely still would've learnt those things if my 1 mid game was instead 3 mid games, and there's a chance those other games could've been even more important pillars to build from.

This time it is looking to *finally*, truly be over, and when I think about the herculean push it took to get here, it neutralizes to not exactly feel like anything. I know my game is objectively better, and I definitely became a better developer, but I also burned through entire real years on an idea I formed when I was nearly half my current age.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding their point, but I guess *my* point is that management itself ends up being the project much of the time, and there isn't enough to go around in our sick society for all of us to waste years on figuring that out for no gain... Unless you want to. I wanted to!
